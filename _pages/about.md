# About Me
I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Economics, as welll as Honours and Masters in Computer Science, all from the University of the Witwatersrand. Further to this I am interested in Neuroscience and Psychology, and read about these fields as much as possible.

My non-academic interests revolve around music (despite a distinct lack of rhythm), movies, sports and cat pictures.

# Research Interests
My prior research revolves primarily around the generalization of artificial neural networks. My most recent work looked at the ability of linear neural networks to systematically generalize. We investigated the impact of dataset structure, architecture and learning regime on this ability and found conditions when systematic generalization could occur.

For my Masters work I looked to create selective plasticity regularizers which were based on the geometry of the loss landscape. By using the metric tensor of this landscape we were able to create regularizers which would adapt their strength based on the individual importance of a parameter to the network as a whole.
