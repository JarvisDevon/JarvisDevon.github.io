This is my first post, hopefully of many, on my personal website. My goal is to use these posts primary to share my research, but perhaps just to talk about whatever interests me.

Thank you for coming to my website and reading this post. Please do not hesitate to get in touch for any reason, be it related to research, advocacy or just to say hi. If you would like to make a similar personal site, I would be happy to share the resouces I used.

Now to end this off with a quote:
Kindness is invincible-if it is sincere; Meditations Book II, verse 18, paragraph 9.
